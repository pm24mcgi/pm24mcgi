## About Me
Full-stack software engineer from Vermont with over 2000 hours of practical application including 1000 hours of classroom experience from an SWE Bootcamp with a 3% acceptance rate. I have developed a strong passion for creating intuitive applications and finding new ways to improve their efficiency.

My journey began working in the financial services industry 10 years ago with Goldman Sachs, later transitioning to a family office and investment firm. The pandemic created a pause in my life that allowed me to contemplate the direction my career was heading. Society is constantly evolving, and technology is consistently at the forefront of those changes. I have always felt a strong desire to contribute to a larger mass of people. My passion for coding affords me the opportunity to use my critical thinking and problem-solving skills. This has enabled me to tap into my creativity and meaningfully contribute to each group I'm a part of.

In my free time I am an avid skier and consider the slopes of Killington Mountain my second home. During the warmer months you will find me fly fishing along local streams, camping in the north country, kayaking surrounding ponds, or hiking with my dog, Hank. ADK 46er in training.
